## Update to version 1.3.1
* More parallel support and some extended functionality. This is mostly a small update with a lot of refactoring of code, however the dependency on flexclust will be dropped in the next release, so documentation needs to reflect that.

## Test environments
* Local Windows 10, R 3.2.3
* Local Linux Mint 17.2, R 3.2.3
* win-builder (devel and release)

## R CMD check results
* There were no ERRORs, WARNINGs or NOTEs
