#' @section Parallel Computing:
#'
#'   Please note that running tasks in parallel does \strong{not} guarantee faster computations.
#'   The overhead introduced is sometimes too large, and it's better to run tasks sequentially.
#'
#'   The user can register a parallel backend, e.g. with the \pkg{doParallel} package, in order to
#'   attempt to speed up the calculations (see the examples).
